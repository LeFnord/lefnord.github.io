Hi, I'm Peter (aka LeFnord), a freelance software developer and trainer from saxony.

If you want to get in contact, to talk about software for web stuff[^1],  
especially the backend of it, please email me <{{site.owner.email}}>

This site expresses only my private thoughts, they are not related to any employer of me.

The Jekyll theme is shameless taken from [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com).
