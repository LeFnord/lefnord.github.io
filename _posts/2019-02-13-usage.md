(It's more for me, to not to forget the handling ðŸ˜‰ )

1. Ensure you have a folder `_drafts`.
2. Run `bin/new_post.rb <Title, with whitespaces>`
   this generates a Markdown file with name
   `<2020-10-10-Title,_with_whitespaces>.md` in `_drafts` folder,
   if exists, else in project folder.
3. To run it local `bundle exec jekyll serve --draft` or `bin/run`
4. If you are ready/finishing writing, move it into to `_posts` folder to publish.
5. push the changes
