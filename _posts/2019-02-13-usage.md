# How to add new posts
(It's more for me, to not to forget the handling ðŸ˜‰ )

1. Ensure you have a folder `_drafts`.  
2. Run `bundle exec ./bin/new_post.rb <title>`,  
   this generates a Markdown file with name `<Date>-<title>.md` in `_drafts` folder.
3. To run it local `bundle exec jekyll serve --draft`
4. If you are ready/finishing writing, move it into to `_posts` folder to publish.
5. push the changes
